              A container image is a stand-alone package that includes everything needed 
              to run an application.

          <h3>Advantages to using docker</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Isolated processes</li>
            <li>More efficient than Virtual Machines</li>
            <li>Consistency across platforms</li>
          </ul>

          <aside class="notes">
            <ul>
              <li>
                Each container runs isolated from it's surroundings and cannot impact 
                it's neighbors. This prevents both malicious and benign conflicts 
                between processes.
              </li>
              <li>
                Virtual Machines take a brute force approach and replicate everything down 
                to the hardware. Containers are much more lightweight and only bundle libraries 
                and settings required to make the software work.
              </li>
              <li>
                Containers guarantees that software will always run the same no matter the platform.

              Back in 2013, when I was starting to learn docker, I came across this article by Michael Crosby, who is
              the chief maintainer of the open-source docker community.</p>
            <code>NEXT</code>
            <p>
              The article was one of the first to describe how multiple containers could be coordinated through 
              the use of volumes. Even though the containers are deeply intertwined, it shows the one process 
              per container paradigm really well. I also really like that it uses a relatable example, something
              that one might use in real life instead of an over simplified app.
            </p>
            <code>NEXT</code>
            <p>
              Unfotunately, a lot has changed since 2013, and it doesn't make use of a lot of the newer features
              of docker.

          <p>Open terminal and create directory</p>
          <pre><code class="nohighlight" data-trim>

            <p>Before we do anything we'll need to install docker if you don't already 
              have it. You can get it by going to docker.com and clicking on the "Get Docker" 
              in the nav menu. Once that's done you should create a directory for this workshop
              and also create a directory inside that for our central project.

              The first thing we are going to want to do is run the Minecraft server. Now we could
              start straight away by writing our own Dockerfile, but I prefer seeing what projects
              have already been created to solve this problem.
            </p>
            <code>next</code>
            <p>
              Chances are someone have already done the work. There are many places you can look
              for one, but I usually just use Google. The first one I found looks good so that's 
              the one we are going to use.
            </p>
            <code>next</code>
            <p>
              Use this command to run the docker container using the image we just picked. The command
              line arguments here do three things. One, we set two environment variables for the
              application inside the container. Two we expose the port that minecraft uses to the 
              host machine. Note that there are two values here allowing us to map the hosted port
              differently than what the application is inside the container. And the last option
              specifies a tag for an existing docker image to run in the container.

              Using the <code>docker ps</code> command we can see all the running 
              containers. <code>docker stop</code> can be used to stop any of the
              containers that are still running. Note that even though we did 
              <code>Ctrl-C</code> the process is still running. Likewise we can 
              delete the container when we are done with it. Let's stop and 
              delete the container running the server.

              We can use all the same commands with docker compose. In fact, even when 
              prototyping I personally find it easier to start with docker-compose and 
              don't bother with the docker cli. Let's take another look at our first 
              step this time using docker-compose.

            <p>As you can see the settings we have here are exaclty the same as command line options
            from before. The difference here is a little bit of extra information at the top.
            <code>version</code> is the version of the docker-compose file format we are using.
            Three is actually the current version, but this tutorial was made with two. The 
            <code>services</code> block is were we will define the containers. Now at the 
            command line we can start the server again, but this time we will be using the 
            docker-compose command.</p>

            Note the line about <code>Creating minecraft_hub_server_1</code>. You'll notice that
            when running <code>docker ps</code>, docker-compose has named this container something
            sensible which is useful if you do need to use docker commands.

            <p>
            I just want to take a second here to point out the usefulness of the environment 
            variables. Now it's obvious that you can use them to tweak settings in the 
            application, but I think the real power of them is removing any environment
            specific information from your container.

            <code>next</code>
            <p>
              Here are just a few examples.
              <ul>
                <li>Pointing between a production database and the development one</li>
                <li>Enabling extra debugging when developing</li>
                <li>Disabling the cache when running locally</li>
              </ul>
              These are just a few examples, but the part I wand to emphasize is that it is
              useful to be able to setup the differences in the different environments your
              application runs in runtime environment variables. This allows you to run the 
              same image in all your environments. The difference between production and
              running it locally can be just the docker-compose file that you use. Both
              testing and debugging production become a lot easier when you know you are
              using the same image throughout.

              So far we've talked about both containers and images, but I want to take a moment
              to describe the differences between them.

            <code>next</code>
            <p>
              Images are snapshots of everything needed to run an application. They are created before
              the application ever runs. When we talk about docker's consistency, it's because the
              application runs off of an image that is the same every time. The <code>images</code> 
              command shows all the images stored on the local machine. In this example, we see the
              one we used earlier to run the minecraft server. It was downloaded from the docker
              repository using the <code>itzg/minecraft-server</code> identifier.
            </p>
            <code>next</code>
            <p>
              Containers on the other hand are runtime instances. They contain all the arguments and 
              runtime configurations and any files changed by the running process. They use images as
              a jumping off point, but two containers from the same image often have many differences
              from the individual runs of the application.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's take a look at how images are created.

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>
              In addition to the server that we set up before, let's add a process to backup the server
              data. Unlike last time we are going to build the docker image from scratch. Start by
              creating a new directory in <code>docker-workshop</code> called <code>snapshots</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
              I've written a simple bash script to take data from one location, zip it up, and send it 
              some where else. Download it and put it in the <code>snapshots</code> directory. This will
              be the basis for our new docker process.

              In the first example, we use <code>volumes_from</code> to share
              directories between different containers. If you looked at the 
              minecraft-server Dockerfile, the <code>VOLUME</code> command 
              exposes these directories including the <code>/data</code>
              one which has the world data we are interested in.

          <aside class="notes">
            The second example uses the <code>volumes</code> option to share a directory with the
            host machine. This links the location on the host machine in the first part to the location
            in the container in the second part. The environment variable tells the 
            script to save the backups to the <code>/backup</code> directory. In a 
            "production" setting we would probably want to put this on S3 or some other remote 
            backup solution to make this setup a little more disposable, but for this demo 
            we'll just copy it to the host machine. The script does have the option to send to S3
            if you want to explore that on your own.

          <h3>Why is it in a separate container?</h3>
          <p>Each container should only have one concern</p>
          <ul class="fragment">
            <li>Containers are more reusable</li>
            <li>Protects each application</li>
            <li>Integrations are more visibly documented</li>
            <li>Containers are replaceable</li>
          </ul>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>
              "Each contaimer should only have one concern" is one of the best practices listed in the 
              docker documentation. Originally this concept was "one process per container" but it was
              changed to avoid confusion with applications like apache that are multi-threaded. Both 
              can be a little confusing in my opinion, but the idea is that each container should ideally
              only have one function. 
            </p>
            <code>next</code>
            <p>
              There are a few reasons why this is a good idea.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Keeping individual functions separated makes it easier to reuse those functions. The snapshot
                  tool used in this workshop for example is not specific to minecraft and could be used in another
                  project. This also makes them easier to test and maintain. The concept is similar to the way that
                  GNU tools work in Linux.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Separate containers also protect against dependency conflicts and security concerns. An example of
                  the former might be having two separate python applications that have different and mutually 
                  exclusive requirements.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Since interations between containers need to be allowed specifically, this weeds
                  out any undocumented interations. It is much easier to see at a glance how different applications
                  interact when they are defined at the container level instead of burried in less obvious scripts 
                  inside the container.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When functions are defined at the container level, it is easier to swap them out with different
                  implementations. An example of this could be statsd collector that could be changed when the
                  metrics service changes.
                </li>
              </ul>

              A way to easily separate local development configuration from a production config is by 
              using a <code>docker-compose.override.yml</code> file that is automatically used by 
              docker-compose to augment those in <code>docker-compose.yml</code>. As a bonus, some tools 
              like those for AWS ECS will ignore the override making it perfect for development. In this
              example we changed the interval between snapshots to one minute instead of the fifteen it
              was before to make it faster to test.

            Now that we have a few containers running lets take a look at the resource allocation for these
            containers using docker's stats command. Not all containers are created equal, but by default 
            docker will split them evenly. Without more information that seems reasonable enough, but in our 
            project the snapshot container getting 2gb is probably overkill. Luckily, docker gives us a couple
            options to control these allocations.

              These two options, unsurprisingly will control the CPU and memory allocation of the containers.
              There are more options than these, including things like ulimit, but this is a good start. The 
              cpu_shares is perhaps a bit odd setting in that 1024 represents a single core. In my experience
              it is something that you have to feel out by running your application and adjusting as needed.
              The mem_limit on the other hand is a bit more straight-forward.

              Now lets add the final piece of our project: a web server to host the map and provide 
              a landing page for our server. Taking a look at the project you can see that it is just
              a simple nginx server with some static web content, but this could easily be a react or
              other frontend application hosted in nginx.

              Again we add this application to the <code>docker-compose</code> inside the minecraft-hub directory
              and set the appropriate options. Note that this time we are using <code>volumes_from</code> the mapgen 
              because we want to host the generated map files.
